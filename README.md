# INFO ABOUT THE BACKEND 

Dear PM colleagues,

You may receive requests for technical support from OmegaT users involved in a project. When this happens, please remind them that they must create a ticket through our helpdesk to get support. The specific way to access the helpdesk depends on the specific project, but uses should have the relevant information in the documentation they have already received.

Creating a ticket as soon as the issue or the question appears is the fastest and most efficient way to get support. On the one hand, that will avoid a time-consuming chain of communication between the user and the PM and sometimes other people and, in turn, between the PM and us (TT). On the other hand, it allows us to receive direct information from the user about the issue without relying on previous exchanges that we may not be fully aware of. It also reduces the potential misunderstandings and omission of details (for example, an inacurate reponse could cause accidental deletion of a project). 

When you explain a user’s problem to one member of the TT, that specific person may not be the one that helps the user.  When we receive a ticket through the helpdesk, we can assign the ticket to whomever among us has capacity or is able to help faster or is more knowledgeable of the issue at hand. Also, the Helpdesk is a collective responsibility of the TT, not of one specific person – contacting one particular member of the TT directly makes it more difficult for us-TT to manage our workload. Finally, through the helpdesk, we are able to document the issues in a particular project, analyze users’ behaviors, and create a knowledge base for us to improve our assistance.

Letting the user explain the technical problem to the PM, then the PM asking TT, then TT asking the PM to tell the user to create a ticket, etc. defeats the purpose of the helpdesk, adds more work for everyone and delays the resolution of the issue. When users create a ticket straight away as soon as the issue or the question appears, the issue is solved or the question is answered very quickly.

In short, we believe that creating a ticket through the helpdesk is the most effective way to efficiently assist the user and move the task forward.

Thank you for your help and understanding! Please forward this message to anyone (e.g. assistant PMs) for whom you find it appropriate.

The Tech Team (aka Adrien, Danina, Manuel, and Valentina)
